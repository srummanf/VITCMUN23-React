                        Committees in HMUN India over the years have been simulated on the basis of the most pressing issues of the time. Historical committees are an exciting way of stepping back in time and revisiting revolutionary discussions that took place in the world. In keeping up with that legacy, delegates at HMUN India 2022 will engage in various simulated committees fostering meaningful deliberations over some of the most relevant topics today.
