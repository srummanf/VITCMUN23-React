                    The Secretariat comprises of qualified individuals well-versed in the conventions and protocols of a
                    Model UN conference. They are responsible for selecting the topics for debate, organizing
                    committees, recruiting and training volunteers, coordinating logistics, and ensuring that the
                    conference runs smoothly. Every successful MUN conference requires a strong MUN Secretariat. They
                    play a crucial role in promoting diplomacy, leadership, and public speaking skills among students.
                    The MUN Secretariat consists of departments such as the Executive Board, Delegate Affairs,
                    Logistics, Communications, and Training and Development. Each department has its own specific
                    responsibilities and works together to ensure that the conference is well-organized and successful.</p>
